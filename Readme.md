MinecraftScript
===============

__Right now this mod is for advanced users only.__

This is my attempt of making a mod which enables JavaScript in Minecraft.

Security Warning
----------------
Due to the nature of this mod access to Java classes is possible so therefore any scripts made using this mod should be treated like a mod themselves.
This basically just means you should be careful with what commands and scripts you run with this mod installed.

To-do
-----
- Add In-Game help system
- Document Everything
- Add Scripted Item support
- Add rest of block identifiers
- Add item identifiers
- Finish Block and Item Texture ID's
- Add rest of creative tabs
- Hide blocks and items not in use from Not Enough Items
- Add more Scripted Block callbacks
- Add Map Graphics API

Thanks
