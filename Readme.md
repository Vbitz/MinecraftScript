MinecraftScript
===============

__Right now this mod is for advanced users only.__

This is my attempt of making a mod which enables JavaScript in Minecraft.

Security Warning
----------------
Due to the nature of this mod access to Java classes is possible so therefore any scripts made using this mod should be treated like a mod themselves.
This basically just means you should be careful with what commands and scripts you run with this mod installed.

To-do - Right from my internal to-do list
-----
- Switch Functions to Vectors
- Add Drop Block Function
- Add ScriptedItem API
- Add Crafting API
- Add Smelting API

- Look at Updating to 1.4.4
- Write Permissions System
- Add Script Runner Block

- Start thinking about balancing for survival
- Finish Texture ID's
- Add rest of creative tabs
